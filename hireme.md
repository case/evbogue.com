### Hire me

**Preface** Once in awhile I get emails from companies and recruiters attempting to hire me. To keep the back and forth to a minimum, I've decided to create this page so you know what I'm looking for.

**Where I'll work** I only want to work at your company or startup if you are located in **New York** or **San Francisco**. I live in New York right now. If you want me to interview with you, I need you to pay travel expenses if you are in SF. If you want me to come work for you in San Francisco, you must pay relocation costs. 

**What I do** I deploy Node.js. This means I'm coding in server-side JavaScript. Ubuntu/Arch Linux at the base of the stack. If you are building or want to maintain a Node.js application, I'm your man. I am not interested in working on projects built on other systems or languages. No Wordpress. No Ruby on Rails. No iOS. Please read Deploy Node before you hire me.

**Relevant skills** I can code HTML5/CSS3 in my sleep. Front-end UI is no problem. I've been designing websites since I was 12, and have kept up with all relevant changes in this industry. 

**Work experience** Gawker Media 2005, Nymag.com 2006-2009, self-employed writer 2009-2012. Current self-employed technical writer and web developer. 

**Education** Graduated NYU Journalism/Dance 2006 in three years. Kindergarten dropout. 9th grade dropout.

**Pay** Six digits or more.

**Where I won't work** No Google. There are no talented people there. No Apple. I'm sorry for your loss, but no. 

Please read [Deploy Node](http://deploy.evbogue.com) before you ask about my skills as a programmer.

Still interested? Pitch me.
