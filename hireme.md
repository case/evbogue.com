### Hire me

**Preface** Once in awhile I get emails from companies and recruiters attempting to hire me. To keep the back and forth to a minimum, I've decided to create this page so you know what I'm looking for.

**Where I'll work** I only want to work at your company or startup if you are located in **New York** or **San Francisco**. I live in New York right now. If you want me to interview with you, I need you to pay travel expenses if you are in SF. If you want me to come work for you in San Francisco, you must pay relocation costs. 

**What I do** I deploy Node.js. This means I'm coding in server-side JavaScript. If you are building or want to maintain a Node.js application, I'm your man. I am not interested in working on projects built on other systems or languages. No Wordpress. No Ruby on Rails. No iOS. 

**Relevant skills** I can code HTML5/CSS3 in my sleep. Front-end UI is no problem. I've been designing websites since I was 12, and have kept up with all relevant changes in this industry. Git. Ubuntu/Debian and Arch Linux.

**Work experience** Gawker Media 2005, Nymag.com 2006-2009, self-employed writer 2009-2012. Current self-employed technical writer and web developer. 

**Education** Graduated NYU Journalism/Dance 2006 in three years. Kindergarten dropout. 9th grade dropout.

**Pay** Six digits or more.

**Where I won't work** No Apple. I'm sorry for your loss, but no. I will only work at Google if you put me on the quantum computer team. No Github. I will not be a part of your flat organizational plan. I want a boss and subordinates. No Coinbase. I don't want people thinking about me when they get phished.

Please read [Deploy Node](http://deploy.evbogue.com) before you email me.

Still interested? Pitch me.
