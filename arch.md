Arch Linux
==========

I'm learning to deploy Arch Linux.

Arch Linux is a minimal distribution of Linux focused on simplicity from the development perspective. You install the Linux Kernal, and Pacman the Arch Linux package manager. 

Once you've installed Arch Linux, you're free to build your system from the ground up the way you want.

Arch Linux has a rolling release schedule. This means you can update the entire system with a single command. Instead of waiting for the next 'big release', you stay in touch with your upstream using Pacman.

Arch Linux is one of the most popular topics on IRC right now. However, there isn't a single book in Barnes and Noble on the subject. Why?

### My stack

Right now, I'm running Arch Linux on a virtual machine.

I'm dual-booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu on my Macbook Pro.
