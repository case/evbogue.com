### The web you know is dying

I'm drinking an espresso shot. It's half-cold. There's still gunk in my eyes from sleeping.

I've been thinking a lot about how I use the Internet. A year ago, I nearly vanished from the public web because I had an intuitive feeling the centralized web was a backdoor to the government. Now, as the dust settles from our collective experiences over the past week, I know this to be true.

So I'm revisiting some of my older habits. I'm using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) to visit websites. I've installed [Torbirdy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/) on Thunderbird. I'm back on [Hyperboria](http://projectmeshnet.org) using [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns). If you want to send me [Bitcoins](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/), I'll take them.

I continue to try to find ways to communicate over the web. Forward security is a must. Distributed peer to peer social is a must. These are two seperate problems.

The kids on Hyperboria have the right idea: if you don't want to be spied on, **evolve beyond reach**. I'm doing just that. 

[Distributed everything](https://medium.com/surveillance-state/19a5db211e47) is where we're going.

The way I see it, if you're still on centralized social networks, you're part of the problem. You can't stick your fingers in your ears anymore and scream 'lalallalal'. All of your information is being recorded, forever, in the nice little boxes you type into all day long.

I'm running more and more under the pseudonym of Ven Portman. I'm powering up a hyperboria-only website at [venportman.com](http://venportman.com). [Evbogue.com](http://evbogue.com) will continue to be my stable public web presence. The madness will happen on Hyperboria.

The centralized Internet you know is dying. We're scattering to darknets everywhere to look for what we'll build next.
