About
=====

I'm Ev Bogue (born Mar 1985, Chicago IL) or pseudonymous as Ven Portman (created Feb 2012, San Francisco CA). I deploy Node and live in Bed-stuy Brooklyn, New York.

In my early life, I dropped out of kindergarten and 9th grade. This gave me some extra time to play around with computers. I'm a self-learner. I hate/question anyone with authority, and tend to rebel if you tell me what to do.

I moved to New York City when I was 18, and left in 2009. Since, I lived all over the world. My favorite places I've lived are Portland, Oakland, San Francisco, Puerto Vallarta, and Japan.

Now I'm back in New York City, because it's the most amazing place on Earth.

### Deploying

<a href="http://deploy.evbogue.com"><img src="/images/deploy.jpg" width="210px" class="profile" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"></a>

In my most recent regeneration (I regenerate, like [The Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_%28Doctor_Who%29)) I'm a technical writer deploying [Node.js](/node). 

Around February 2012, it became clear the way I'd been writing in the past wasn't going to work for the future. So I created Ven Portman as my pseudonymous avatar to go out ahead of me and explore the future edge of technology. 

While I was circumnavigating the globe during 2012 (Singapore, Tokyo, Berlin), Ven Portman was wandering towards the fringes of teh Internets. What he discovered is this: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is the future. 

I believe in a distributed web. If we're going to break out of centralized information states, we need to deploy our own code. 
If you feel confused, look at it like this: Ev Bogue does the writing, Ven Portman does the coding.

Ev Bogue documents Ven Portman's process in [Deploy Node](/node).

I co-built [Bitters](http://bitters.evbogue.com), a git-based real-time website container using [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), and [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/). You're looking at Bitters right now.

### Writing

<a href="/odyssey"><img src="/images/theodyssey.jpg" width="210px" class="profile" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"></a>

I've been a writer for as long as I can remember. I deployed my first webpage to Geocities in 1997. I was twelve. I started [Livejournal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal)ing (one of the first blogging platforms) in 1999. 

I went to NYU (New York University) for dance, but ended up graduating with a degree in Journalism. I took the first blogging class at NYU. I was hired at [Gawker Media](http://gawker.com/) while I was still at NYU. 

After school, I tried to work at the 5th Ave Apple Store in Manhattan, but dropped out to pursue a career as a photo editor at [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com). I worked at Nymag for three years, then I quit to pursue career as a professional writer.

I refer to the next three years as [The Odyssey](/odyssey). During that time, I wrote four ebooks as I traveled back and forth from Portland, Brooklyn, Oakland, San Francisco, Boulder, Seattle, Puerto Vallarta, and back to San Francsico. Most of my [haters](/haters) sprung up during this time. Jealousy is just love and hate at the same time.
