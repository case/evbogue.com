### About Ev Bogue

I'm a technical writer and web developer specializing in deploying Node.js. Because Node.js is awesome. 

I live in Bed-stuy Brooklyn. I moved to New York City when I was 18. Ten years ago. I stuck around too long, then left for a bit to travel the world -- Tokyo, Berlin, Mexico and in-between. Now I'm back, and loving it. New York City is the best place on Earth. I don't make as much sense outside of New York. But here, I do the work. If you want to come here, you should. If you can't handle it, then you should leave. The same goes for my work.

I regenerate. Like The Doctor. Because the only way to survive in the modern world is to revent yourself. People who stick with one thing eventually stagnate, and aren't valuable anymore. Because what was beneficial a few years ago, isn't getting the same traction.

I believe in the distributed web. And I put my money where my mouth is. So I don't do centralized social networking. Because if you're a user, then you're being used. So I deploy Node.

I have an on-going technical writing project [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de) where I document everything worth learning about Node. If you want to deploy Node, then [deployno.de](http://deployno.de) is the place to land. And bring your credit card or Bitcoins, because good shit ain't free.

I'm most known for owning no stuff. I still don't. Junk is junk, and it's getting in your way. Before doing the dev thing, I worked at Gawker, and then at New York Magazine. I've been featured on CBS News (for the minimalist thing).

I've lived in a hotel in Mexico with a panoramic view of the ocean, and I've been homeless. Because to do anything important in this world, you have to risk everything. And sometimes it works out, and other times it doesn't. Tough shit. You get back to work. But if you've never done the work, then you have no idea what I'm talking about. You're probably just scared shitless of being successful, or being homeless. Or both.

I've smoked a pack a day, and practiced yoga three times a day. I've eaten an all meat diet, I've been a vegan. I say fuck veganism. I've never been as useless as when I was trying to eat all vegetables. Give me a burger.

The best way to reach me is via email â€“ [ev@evbogue.com](mailto:ev@evbogue.com). But let me warn you, I will ask you to put your money where your keyboard is. If you don't have any money, then figure out how to get some. Because not having money is no excuse for not trying to earn some. Stop emailing me whining about being unemployed. Suck it up and learn some technical skills. Have your mom buy you [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de), or your boss, or if you can afford it yourself then by all means. It's oly $37 for godsake. You spent that at brunch last week, unemployed or not.

The people who read me are willing to do the work. They're hard workers. They have technical skills. They believe in a distributed Internet. They don't let themselves be brainwashed by hugemongous megacorporations creating brain-squeezing Internet ghettos for the bottom of the barrel specimens of mankind to hang out and poke each other. 

The people who read me deploy. Whether it's Node, or whatever your favorite language or web server happens to be. 

We don't just sit around talking about shit. 

We hit git push origin master.
