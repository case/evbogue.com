I'm hiring
=========

I'm looking for a few talented people, who are familiar with my work, to create a tight-knit and effective marketing team for my work.

How this works: 

Once you're on the marketing team, you'll get kickbacks for every copy of my work you sell to your audience.

What this means is I'm now paying my readers to support me, in addition to my readers paying me to do the work. This way, we all get something out of the work I'm doing: financial benefit. In addition to good shit worth reading.

Here's how it works. 

1. You apply for the kickback program
2. You sell a copy of my work
3. You you get 50%, I get 50%

If you sell a copy of [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de), you'll get $18.50. When you sell two copies, you'll make $37. Then, you'll make back your purchase price by spreading the word.

I'm the author, and you're bookseller, and the marketing department. With this new environment, I make more from the work, and so can you.

If you want to be a part of this, I ask that you email me. This way we can connect in brief before you start doing the work and getting paid.

Apply now to join the kickback team:
