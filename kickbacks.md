Kickbacks
=========

Hey People,

I've decided I'm ready to take my online business to the next level. 

And I think you might be ready to help me out.

Starting now, I'm offering kickbacks to anyone who sells copies of my work to the people in their audience who need them.

I'm paying my readers to support me. This way, we can all get something out of the work I'm doing. Besides just good shit worth reading.

Here's how it works. 

1. You apply for the kickback program
2. You sell a copy of my work
3. You you get 50%, I get 50%

If you sell a copy of [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de), you'll get $18.50. If you sell two copies, you'll make $37. Then, you'll make back your purchase price just by spreading the word. If you sell 150 copies, then you'll be able to quit your job and build the distributed web for a living.

I'm the author, and you're bookseller, and the marketing department. This way I can make more from the work, and so can you.

If you want to be a part of this, I only ask that you email me. This way we can connect in brief before you start doing the work and getting paid.

Tell me:

1. Your name
2. Your website
3. Your brief marketing plan

I'll email you back with the link to the kickback program within 24 hours.
