Buy my old shit
===============

People always ask me for my old shit. 

Even though everyone threw their shit in a dumpster two years ago (if they had the guts) and then said Fuck Minimalism, you still want to read The Art of Being Minimalist.

Or maybe you never read Augmented Humanity, because it was a little too esoteric for you at the time. Now you're seeing cyborgs everywhere, and you wonder what I thought about that back in the day. 

Perhaps you really want to start a Minimalist Business and learn to live and work from anywhere. Even though that ship sailed a long time ago. Even though the strategies I wrote about in 2010 are guaranteed to not work in 2013! You still want to quit your job and try it, even though you'll have to make up your own strategies.

Perhaps you're only just now hearing about how to Untether to Evolve, and now you want to try learning some new verbs to use as you untether from the shit that's holding you back.

Regardless, you still want my old shit. No matter how much I email you back saying 'please stop asking for my old shit, it's not relevent anymore' you keep wanting it. 

So, I have relented. Here is my best old shit. Some of it even comes in PDF form, for those of you who like to download bricks.
