I have a receive-only inbox. Private communication on the Internet is not guaranteed at the present moment, since the NSA is recording everything Americans send in private for later use at the FISA secret courts. 

Why pretend there's any privacy in the world, when there isn't? When you send me an email, I'll answer it here. Your name will be obscured for your own semi-privacy. 

Keep in mind, just because you send me an email doesn't mean I'll take the time to answer it.

Receive only inbox: [ev@evbogue.com](mailto:ev@evbogue.com)

You can also catch me on [hypeirc](http://hypeirc.net) and #bitters on freenode.

### Outbox

To: J.O.S.

To answer your questions about learning Arch Linux, [Bitters](http://bitters.evbogue.com), and Node.js in one month. I think you can! If you want to jump in the deep-end, install Arch Linux on your laptop. If you don't, try installing Ubuntu or another full-functioned Linux distro first.

You're using a Windows machine, right? If you follow the instructions on the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) to boot from a usb stick, with enough jiggering you should be able to get it to boot. 

Once you get Arch Linux installed, you can get the Node.js package

	pacman -S nodejs

This will install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and all of it's dependencies.

As far as the three countries you mentioned we should meet up in, India is where I'd like to go next. I'd like to get the one-year India visa, and go wander around India. I'd like to be self-sufficient enough to not have to work during this time, or have a business running in the background (on systemd?) so I don't have to worry about connectivity while I'm wandering.
