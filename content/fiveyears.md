### The next 5 years in technology

2004 - 2009 were some of the most amazing years in technology. Contrary to what most people still think, it is NOT 2009 anymore. It's 2013, and next year will be 2014. This means 10 years of Gmail, and 10 years of Stasibook.

You and your friends might be clinging to ten years of email and social network updates, but most of my friends aren't. Instead of clinging to the past, I thought it might be interesting to paint a future in technology worth living for. 

So I used my brain to time-travel ahead five years, and here is what I found while I was there.

Over the next five years, Apple stocks plummet as the company fails to innovate, leaks talent. Everyone buys either inexpensive Acer/Asus all-in-one laptops, or starts building their own personal mesh devices from parts purchased from Ada Fruit and other computer kit distributors.

In the next five years, Google crashes overnight from one of the most expensive stocks on the planet to one of the cheapest. In hindsight, we recognize the company had almost no in-world marketing and gave away all of their best stuff for free. When free wasn't good enough anymore, customers began choosing paids services promising to keep their information actually secure (not just faux-secure) and/or go back to keeping their data safe on a personal encrypted harddrive. 

The most common operating system on the planet is already Linux, but over the next few years we'll see free and open distributions of Linux running more often pn personal machines. No technologist will be caught dead running Mac OS X by 2015.

Mesh networking takes off in all major/relevent American cities, starting in DIY communities such as Detroit, Seattle, and Oakland, California. The first intra-city mesh network ends up being a three point network between Oakland, Bernal Heights and Twin peaks. Making The Bay the first group of cities to declare independence from ISPs and cell phone companies. Internet becomes a free human right instead of a monthly tax from evil gods in the sky.

Personal mesh devices become the coolest thing you can own. If you can't mod it, you won't buy it. Interchangable plug and play parts become more common. Tiny screens plug into tiny processors plug into tiny keyboards and batteries. The maker scene collides with the mesh networking scene and the open source Linux scene. 

Arch Linux is the model for how all modern operating systems are built.

Node.js explodes as the open source server of the future. The world-wide-mesh is reshaped by tiny modulare node servers that follow Substack's ethos of all doing one thing well. The first Node.js 'killer app' is a distributed social networking client, allowing anyone to microblog without any fear of censorship. The second Node.js 'killer app' is a distributed peer to peer forward-secure way of talking to your friends without the NSA spying on your conversation.

All in all, the next five years in technology prove to be much more exciting, and accessible to the people who have the brains and guts to get involved in the hard technical stuff right now. Not five years from now. New fortunes are made, old fortunes are lost. 

Will you be there to see it?
