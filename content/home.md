### About Ev Bogue

Ev Bogue (born Everett Bogue Chicago March 4 2013) is pseudononymous Ven Portman (created San Francisco Feb 11 2012) is a technical writer and web developer. Right now, for privacy, he lives at an undisclosed location. 

His piece [Distributed Everything](https://medium.com/surveillance-state/19a5db211e47) was featured on the Hacker News top 5 for almost 24 hours on July 4 2013. He's still replying to all of the emails.
 
Ev deploys [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), and runs [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on his Macbook Pro and VPS. And yes, it was a bitch to get it on there. It was worth it. Ev operates a [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) node, visit him on [Hyperboria](http://hyperboria.net/).

Ev is the author of [Deploy Node](http://deploy.evbogue.com) and two other work-in-progress technical documents.

Ev has been involved in tech since he created his first "webpage" on Geocities in 1997. He was twelve years old. Since, he's worked at blogging empires such as Gawker and New York Magazine. CBS News flew all the way to Oakland to [interview him](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6994343n) when minimalism was a passing fad. He still lives out of one bag.

Ev moved to New York City at the age of 18, and left in 2009. He has since lived in Portland (2009), Brooklyn (2010) Oakland (2010), San Francisco (2010), Schmoulder (2011), Seattle (2011), Puerto Vallarta (2011-2012), San Francisco (2012), the authoritarian regime Singapore (2012), Tokyo (2012), Berlin (2012), and Kansas City (2012).
