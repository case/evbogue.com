### Coding to the people

As many of you know, I'm a huge supporter of [Yoga to the People](http://yogatothepeople.com). I've gone through their yoga teacher training program. I've taken classes there since 2006.

Yoga to the People has a tissue box. At the end of the class, you give whatever you can give. Whether it's $1, $7, the suggested $10 or even $100. It's up to you.

This donation model works really well for them. They have locations all over NYC, Seattle, San Francisco (where I did my teacher training), and they've openned a new one in Tempe, AZ. 

Yoga to the People works because when people get value from the practice, they give at the end of class. 

The tissue box is always overflowing with money.

I figure if I've taken 2000 classes there over the past 8 years, and I give an average of $7. I've given YTTP $14,000 since I've started taking classes there. Plus $2,500 for teacher training. Alone, I've given an estimated $16,500 to Yoga to the People over the past 7 years! Is that crazy or what?

I keep going back, and I keep giving them money. Why? Because I get something out of it.

I'd like to try the digital tissue box model for technical writing and web development. 

If you like what I'm writing, consider dropping a small amount every week in the digital tissue box.
