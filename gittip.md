The Digital Tissue Box
=======================

### Coding to the people

As many of you know, I'm a huge supporter of [Yoga to the People](http://yogatothepeople.com). I've gone through their yoga teacher training program. I've taken classes there since 2006.

Yoga to the People has a tissue box. At the end of the class, you give whatever you can give. Whether it's $1, $7, the suggested $10 or $100. It's up to you.

This donation model works really well for them. They have locations all over NYC, Seattle, San Francisco (where I did my teacher training), and they're opening a new one in Tempe, AZ. 

Yoga to the People works because when people get value from the practice, they give at the end of class. 

The tissue box is always overflowing with money.

I figure if I've taken 2000 classes there over the past 8 years, and I give an average of $7. I've given YTTP $14,000 since I've started taking classes there. Plus $2,500 for teacher training. Alone, I've given $16,500 to Yoga to the People over the past 7 years! Is that crazy or what?

And I keep going back, and I keep giving them money. Why? Because I get something out of it.

### Can donations work for digital work?

Every time I've tried to go donation-based, it's failed horribly. So, since 2009 I've been successful at doing the product thing.

Hence why I have [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de) for sale right now. You probably spent $37 at brunch last weekend, without even thinking about it. This doesn't seem like much to ask you to spend on your education.

Selling products works. But packaging everything I do up is a container. It means people who can't afford it can't access my work. 

### The Gittip model

I'd like to ask you to support my work by making a weekly donation, of $1, $7, the suggested $10 or $100 if you have it to give.

One of the guys I've connected with most since I've been back on Twitter this week is [Chad Whitacre](http://whit537.org/). He's the guy who created Gittip.

Gittip is an easy way for people with money to support developers doing the work in the world. Every Thursday the digital tissue box gets passed around and people get paid to do the work that matters most to them.

Everything is public on Gittip. I love that. 

### The plan

Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to do both until I can quit the affiliate marketing thing.

This is the caveat: If I start making enough on Gittip to live a decent life in this cheap apartment in Bedstuy, Brooklyn I will make all of my past and future work free. I'll take affiliate marketing off the table at that point.

Now, you'll probably email saying that I my work is amazing and it should travel on it's own merits, and people should just give out of the kindness of their hearts. Blah blah blah. This is naive bullshit.

We all know it doesn't work this way. 

I only earn if you buy my products right now. And I'd prefer not to affiliate ever again. So, I want to do the Yoga to the People model for my work starting today. 

For it work, I need your help.

### Here's the deal.

If I start making enough on Gittip to meet my basic needs here in NYC, I'll make all of my writing work past and present free.

If I'm making enough on Gittip, all of humanity can benefit from the work I'm doing.

Then I can get to work on figuring out this distributed social thing, so we can all benefit from that as well.

If the spacetime continuum explodes and I start making oodles on Gittip, I'll redistribute the wealth to talented developers who are building the technologies we will use and benefit from in the future.

I won't have to squeeze you for cash anymore. I won't have to frak my soul doing affiliate marketing.

Everyone wins. 

Won't that be amazing?
