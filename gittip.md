Why Gittip?
===========

Hey...

### Can I level with you?

I know it's hard. I know no one wants to hear the truth. But sometimes we have to talk about it.

I have to make money to keep doing the work.

And there aren't enough of you out there supporting the work I do in the world. If you bought [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de), then you are. But if you didn't, you aren't. You're just taking. And just taking is not enough for me to keep doing the work.

I have around 2000 people who receive letters from me every time I post. Most of you open it every time I send. But most of you aren't generous enough to contribute even a dollar. Which is too bad. Because you always email me to say how much you love my shit. But emails aren't money. Tweets can't feed you.

My parents don't even support my work. They read it all right, but they don't support it. The biggest advocates I've had over the past four months have been Gwen Bell's grandparents. They were the ones who when things got tough did everything in their power to make sure she and I didn't starve last winter.

And still, you send emails saying you love my shit, and I should just keep doing the work! Keep on fighting! You say. And then you send nothing, or don't buy my stuff.

### Affiliate marketing

I used to do affiliate marketing. It's how I first got started in publishing. The method is simple. I pay you 50% when you sell a copy of my work. 

Recently, I figured I have to find some way of compromising in order to keep doing the work. So I think to myself, what's the devil I know the most? affiliate marketing. 

So I got in touch with the people I know from that world. It's been awhile, but they're still willing to level with me. I hear they're doing well. They're thriving even. Still. Because when people spread the word about your product, and they're getting paid for it, word travels and copies fly off the shelves.

But affiliate marketing gives your soul a karmic fraking up the ass. It's hard in a different way. Because you don't know if people are going to tell the honest truth about your products. When you're getting paid 50% to rep a product, you're going to say anything to sell copies if you need to do it to pay rent. Desperation can say some pretty funny things when affiliate marketing money is involved.

Now, I'm not desperate right now. 

I'm selling enough copies of Deploy Node to make a living here in Bedstuy Brooklyn. My rent is pretty cheap, I'm sharing a room with Gwen Bell. 

I'm going to make it, whether or not you give me another dollar. However, I will have to do the affiliate marketing thing if I'm to make more than ends meat. Even though I don't want to.

### Giving the gift of money

As many of you know, I'm a huge supporter of [Yoga to the People](http://yogatothepeople.com). I've gone through their yoga teacher training program. I've taken classes there since 2006.

Yoga to the People has a tissue box. At the end of the class, you give whatever you can give. Whether it's $1, $7, the suggested $10 or $100. It's up to you.

This donation model works really well for them. Yoga to the People has locations all over NYC, Seattle, San Francisco (where I did my teacher training), and they're opening a new one in Tempe, AZ. 

Yoga to the People works because when people get value from the practice, they give at the end of class. The tissue box is always overflowing with money.

I figure if I've taken 2000 classes there over the past 8 years, and I give an average of $7. I've given YTTP $14,000 since I've started taking classes there. Plus $2,500 for teacher training. This means I've given, just me, $16,500 to Yoga to the People over the past 7 years! Is that crazy or what?

And I keep going back, and I keep giving them money. Why? Because I get something out of it.

### Can donations work for digital work?

Every time I've tried to go donation-based, it's failed horribly. People don't want to give to me. So I do the product thing, which means I'm squeezing all of the time. Even though I work my ass off every single day, I'm not necessarily doing exactly what I want, because I want to make sure there are the boundaries of the product are there so you will have something to buy.

Hence why I have [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de) for sale right now. It's only $37. Which is nothing compared to the value in there, collected from the four months of generous time Gwen Bell's grandparents gave me to learn some coding skills in their basement. You probably spent $37 at brunch last weekend, without even thinking about it. And yet you hesitate to spend this on your own education.

I'm at a crossroads right now. I have to make a living doing the work I'm called to do in the world. For me, that's both deploying and teaching you how to improve your coding skills.

I'm a technical writer now. And I'm also a web developer.

But I also need to make a living. So, as I mentioned above, I'm thinking about going back to affilate marketing.

Even though I know a part of my soul will die if I do.

### The Gittip model

I want to do the Yoga to the People model. 

I want to get donations, weekly, to do the work I love in the world.

Not because I want the money. Because I just need enough to do the work I love in the world, and get paid to do it. 

One of the guys I've connected with most since I've been back on Twitter is [Chad Whitacre](http://whit537.org/). He's the guy who created Gittip.

Gittip is an easy way for people with money to support developers doing the work in the world. Every Thursday the digital tissue box gets passed around and people get paid to do the work that matters most to them.

Everything is public on Gittip. So I can see that Heroku (a major player in the development space) only gives $121 per week. Which is just sad. Heroku overcharges huge amounts on services that should be free (and can be, I'll show you how) and barely gives back to the community. Github, another company that makes oodles from developers, gives nothing back at all. Apple? Nope. Google. Nope? Microsoft? Nope.

And the top developers here are barely making ends meat. 

Substack, one of the brightest minds working on Node.js right now, only makes $31.50 per week. That's barely enough to buy Tacos for a few days in Oakland.

Tj Holowaychuk only makes $9.74! How will he feed his bird?

These are the guys who love to build all of the free modules you and I relay on every day. And they're making pennies!

Why? Because the donation model doesn't seem to work online. There's very little giving happening. And so much charging.

So I'm left with this choice. 

Do I go back to affiliate marketing, or do I find a way to pass the tissue box around?

### The plan

Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to do both until I can quit the affiliate marketing thing.

This is the cavaet: If I start making enough on Gittip live a decent life in this cheap apartment in Bedstuy, Brooklyn. I will make all of my work free. Affiliate marketing won't be an option anymore.

Now, you'll probably email saying that I my work is amazing and it should travel on it's own merits, and people should just give out of the kindness of their hearts. Blah blah blah. This is naive bullshit.

We all know it doesn't work this way. 

I only earn if you buy my products right now. I've tried the donation thing, and it hasn't worked in the past. If it's going to work, you have to prove to me publically, but getting out your precious credit card and gittiping me.

I really want this to work. I want to do the Yoga to the People model for my work. 

But for it work, I need your help.

### Here's the deal.

If I start making enough on Gittip to meet my basic needs here in NYC, I'll make all of my work free. I figure this will be around $750 per week, minimum.

If I'm making enough on Gittip, all of humanity can benefit from the work I'm doing.

Then I can get to work on figuring out this distributed social thing, so we can all benefit from it as well.

If for some odd reason the spacetime continuum explodes and I start making oodles on Gittip, I'll redistribute the wealth to talented developers who are building the technologies we will use and benefit from in the future.

And I won't have to squeeze you for cash anymore. I won't have to frak my soul doing affiliate marketing.

Won't that be amazing?
