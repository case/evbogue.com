### How to make $1,923 a week on Gittip?

I think it's funny how many people have expressed amazement that I'm making $11.25 a week on Gittip (when I wrote this, check Gittip for current amount). 

This isn't a lot. Doing the math, this is at max $45 a month. Which is way less than you spent last week going out for beer and burgers. I make almost as much money selling one copy of [Deploy Node](http://deploy.evbogue.com/).

My intention is not to make $11.25 a week forever. My aim is much higher. I don't think it's hard to expect I'll be making $500 a week on Gittip soon. And my ultimate goal would be to make $1,923 per week on Gittip. $1,923 per week is only $100,000 a year. 

I've made almost this much per year just writing on the Internet before. I expect when you add my development knowledge, I should be able to do better.

So why are we aiming so low? Let's set our sights higher with Gittip. Get an account on [Gittip](http://gittip.com)! As a few people to support your work in a direct way. Don't be alarmed if they start [hating you](/haters) or even unsubscribe from your list, unfollow you, and even stop inviting you to Thanksgiving. If this happens to you, you're in good company. You can't do good work and please everybody. 

You might have to lose friends and level with people in order to make it online in 2013.

The reward, I'm hoping, is I'll have a distributed genius grant. My [1,000 true fans](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php) can all help pay for my work. Whether you're giving $1 a week or $24, you're giving the rest of the world more value.

Because you all know, I won't just sit on my ass and watch television. And if I do stop doing the work, you can always stop supporting me.

### Coding to the people

As many of you know, I'm a huge supporter of [Yoga to the People](http://yogatothepeople.com). I've gone through their yoga teacher training program. I've taken classes there since 2006.

Yoga to the People has a tissue box. At the end of the class, you give whatever you can give. Whether it's $1, $7, the suggested $10 or even $100. It's up to you.

This donation model works really well for them. They have locations all over NYC, Seattle, San Francisco (where I did my teacher training), and they've openned a new one in Tempe, AZ. 

Yoga to the People works because when people get value from the practice, they give at the end of class. 

The tissue box is always overflowing with money.

I figure if I've taken 2000 classes there over the past 8 years, and I give an average of $7. I've given YTTP $14,000 since I've started taking classes there. Plus $2,500 for teacher training. Alone, I've given an estimated $16,500 to Yoga to the People over the past 7 years! Is that crazy or what?

I keep going back, and I keep giving them money. Why? Because I get something out of it.

I'd like to try the digital tissue box model for technical writing and web development. 

If you like what I'm writing, consider dropping a small amount every week in the digital tissue box.
