Node.js
=======

I deploy [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

Evbogue.com is built on [Bitters](http://bitters.evbogue.com/), which is deployed using Node.js.

I've created a resource called [Deploy Node](http://deployno.de). I created Deploy Node because I'm a technical writer, and I get a lot of questions about Node. 

As I was learning Node, I found the documentation around Node.js to be kind of sparse and scattered. In response, I put all of my collected notes into an easy to read resource to assist you as you learn to deploy Node.

Deploy Node is of course, deployed using Node.

Visit [deployno.de](http://deployno.de) to learn more.

There's a sizable community of Node.js developers on IRC. Visit [Freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net) and join #node.js. Watch the stream go by, or ask your specific question there.
