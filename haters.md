Haters gon' hate

### How to lose friends and level with people

> "And if they hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up." - Kanye

Some people don't like me for a lot of reasons. This is why I have a haters page, so I can explain to you why certain people (and groups of people) don't like me, and why.

I have haters for the same reason Kanye, Lil Wayne, and Drizzy have haters. Because I've been insanely successful, I've bottomed out a few times. And still, I'm becoming successful again. Some people hate me for being successful, other people hate me for being broke. Some people hate me for both.

So why do people hate me? I'll break it down by the eras for you.

### The minimalist days

> "Jealousy is just love and hate at the same time." - Drake

Most of my haters date back to 2009-2010. I ran a successful blog called Far Beyond The Stars. I wrote about how to be minimalist and live and work from anywhere in the world. This blog reached around 80,000 people at its peak in the summer of 2010. 

Many of these people hated me because they had lots of junk, and didn't have the balls to throw out their stuff. Or they wanted to quit their jobs, to travel the world, but didn't have the balls to give 2 weeks notice.

### Ev Bogue, douchebag

The first guy to call me this was another blogger from Brooklyn who ran an anonymous blog hating on hipsters who ride bikes. I have no idea why he hated hipsters so much. Maybe he really wanted to bike? Or he really wanted to shop at American Apparel but wasn't letting himself? At some point he noticed my blog was getting more traffic than his, and the hate began. He wrote a blog post calling me a douchebag, I ignored the blog post, and it's still out there to this day.

The tagline has stuck, with many other people who don't like me using it over the years.

I've been known to, at times, be brutally honest with people. To me, this is just leveling. 

For example: "No, SEO doesn't work anymore. Wordpress is a Botnet now. Steve Jobs died in 2011, he's been dead for two years. Adding an inch to your iPhone does not add an inch to your penis. Node.js is better than Ruby on Rails."

This is misinterpreted as being a douchebag, when in fact what I'm doing is leveling with you. Because I care. If I don't care about you, then I won't level with you. This is worse, because now I have no idea you exist anymore.

Now, Ev Bogue douchebag is the autofill for my Google search. Why? Because Google in 2013 is the National Enquirer of search engines. It weights search results based on drama, instead of value. This is why I use [Duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com). Compare my search results on these two search engines, and you will become enlightened.

### Fuck Minimalism

Still more haters came out when I created a website called fuckminimalism.com in February 2011. 

Fuck Minimalism was a one-page website where I called out a whole bunch of people (but did NOT name names!) for writing minimalist blogs, but not living the lifestyle. They still had houses, and garages full of shit, but they were calling themselves minimalists. You can't be a minimalist and a hoarder at the same time, I said. This seemed like common sense to me.

Other people begged to differ, and now I don't even use the word minimalist anymore. Because it's been coopted by compulsive hoarders.

After my brief stint fucking minimalism, I realized I was living in opposition to people. So I deleted that domain and decided to find better things to do with my life.

### Cyborg discrimination

In early 2011, after I quit the minimalism thing, I wrote an ebook called Augmented Humanity. (Buy it in [The Odyssey](/odyssey))

I'd gotten really into the intersection of humanity and technology, and the effects it had on people. When people pick up new tech, it changes them. A person before they get on the Internet is different than after. A person before they use a Zipcar is different than after.

I hypothesized that within two years, we'd see a company attempt to launch Augmented Reality glasses, and we'd start to get all sorts of amazing data in real time. At the time, a lot of people called me crazy. Little did I know that in two years, Google would launch Google Glass and balding men would get together and livestream as they sucked each other's dicks. We haven't actually seen this happen yet, but just you wait.

In Augmented Humanity, I made the controversial decision to refer to humans as cyborgs. Some people really got it, but other people really didn't. Which, unlike the minimalist hoarder thing, I take full responsibility for. 

Humans like to be called humans. Humans do not liked to be labeled cyborgs. Lesson learned. 

### The Hotel in Mexico

In the summer of 2011 I took all of my products off the web and focused on writing to a small email list of people who really cared about my work. Around 250 people paid me $25 a month to get letters called Evolving Your Digital Work. You can do the math. I wrote this while I was living in Seattle for six months in the summer/fall of 2011, and then I wandered down the west coast through San Francisco, and jumped on a plane to Puerto Vallarta Mexico.

I had enough money coming in from the letters, so I decided to live in a hotel on the beach in Mexico for a month over the winter. Then I moved to a condo in Puerto Vallarta for another month.

At this point, a lot of people got really jealous. The hate began again. 

Why? For the same reason people hate Kanye. Because he makes money, and he's good at what he does.

Also, I have a feeling a large number of my readers were freezing to death in the United States over the winter. Meanwhile, I was sipping mango smoothies on the beach. I'd be jealous too.

But really, why didn't you just move to Mexico too? It's way cheaper in Mexico than it is to live in the United States. You shouldn't be jealous, you should try it for a winter.

And reality is, it's not all good down there. Many nights I had to put up with mariachi bands playing until 4am. And obviously Mexico is a little rough around the edges in places. It's not exactly your cush-as-hell house in the suburbs you're sending me aggressive emails from.

### Circumnavigating the globe

During 2012, I traveled a lot. In the beginning of 2012, I started out by flying from San Francisco to Singapore. I alternated between living in a beautiful condo near the presidential palace in Singapore, and in a strange room with a bathroom without a door over an educational startup in Paya Lebar.

Next, I jumped on a plane to Tokyo, Japan. Where I lived in Yokohama for a bit, and then took a bullet train down to Kyoto. Japan is an amazing place.

Then I jumped on a plane to Berlin via London. In Berlin, I ran out of money. The first month was fine, but I underestimated how many people would drop off the Internet in July to enjoy the summer sunrays. Because my income comes from the Internet, and I was getting less and less of it, things started to get really bad.

So I put out a cry for help. I sent an email to my list, and wrote a little post on Google+ asking for donations to get back to the United States. 

I imagined it would be better to be homeless in the US than in a foreign country where I didn't know the language. This turned out to be true.

Apparently people hate you when you run out of money too! Sometimes even the same people who hate you when you have tons of money. A handful of haters decided to kick me while I was down. 

I ran out of money while I was doing exactly what I wanted to do with my life, traveling the entire fucking world. 

Most of the 'Ev Bogue scam' stuff started during this time. I'm not sure why, because I was making nearly zero dollars. How can you scam people without taking their money? 

I will level with you again. You have to be an idiot to call me a scammer. I've always used PayPal or Amazon Payments. Any person who has ever bought [Deploy Node](http://deploy.evbogue.com/) or [The Odyssey](/odyssey) has had, and will have, the opportunity to get in touch with me or a person at Amazon or PayPal if they feel they didn't get what they paid for. 

As far as I can tell, haters just throw around this word because it gets them attention.

### Learning to deploy

During the last few months of 2012, and the first few months of 2013 I got the pleasure of hanging out in Gwen Bell's grandparent's basement. This was good because I got to upgrade my tech skills while living rent-free.

Not wanting to end up technologically unemployable again, I decided to learn some valuable technical skills. More hate ensued, because now I know more about Deploying Node than you do.

Learning to [deploy Node.js](http://deploy.evbogue.com/) is probably one of the hardest things I've done with my life to date. It's a different kind of challenge than traveling around the globe, or throwing out all of your shit. 

### Finding peace in a sea of hatred

If you want to read the old projects that many people have loved to hate over the years, you're invited to [buy The Odyssey](/odyssey).

The way I see it, if I wasn't doing anything important, people wouldn't hate me. And if you want to do anything important, people will hate you. If you can't learn how to deal with haters, you will not do anything with your life. I've learned to deal with haters in the best way possible. 

If you hate, I will either ignore you or block you. If I ignore you, it's probably because I don't care about you. If I block you, it's probably because I do. I want to give you the opportunity to get on with your life. Blocking is the best way to do this.

When in doubt, the best advice I can give you is to do something with your life. Haters are almost never people who have interesting things going on. And if you don't have any haters whatsoever, you probably don't.

You going to hate me for saying so?
