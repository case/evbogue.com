### The Deep End

I wander through the racks of Barnes and Noble in Union Square. I'm looking for Node.js. Here it is, the one O'reilly book. It's good. I can't hate on it. It's just too bad it's written about Node 6.4, back before there were things like the streaming API. 
 
The other topic I'm looking for, one of the most popular channels on IRC, is nowhere to be found on the racks.

The technological scene changes so fast, it's hard to keep up when you're printed on paper.

You know you're in the deep end when it hasn't hit the shelves yet. You know you're at the technological edge when no one has heard of it. 

And isn't the point to be on the edge?

Why are we so shy of edges? 

In New York we have lots of rooftop parties. People call everyone up and they show up with bottles of vodka and tonic. 

I'm always the first person sitting at the edge of the roof with my legs dangling over the edge. Yes, I could fall. But I won't. I promise. 

And when it's my time to jump, I promise there will be no fuckin' way you will stop me.

So are you only coming up to the edge to tell me not to jump? Because that's useless. There's no way I'm listening to you. Because the topics I'm interested in aren't in Barnes and Noble yet. And as one of my roommates just mentioned, they are slowly closing all of the Barnes and Nobles in Manhattan. I can't even think of a Barnes and Noble in Brooklyn. 

What will all of you Normals do when the the last Barnes and Noble closes? How will you know what's in? Will you just buy the latest bullshit that's put in front of you. Or will you develop the intuition to know what the cutting edge of technological evolution is? 

The way I look at it, you need to be [deploying Node.js](http://deployno.de) if you call yourself a technologist. Right now. Not two years from now.

This is the edge. It's not jumping off it. Someday it'll be the middle. By that time I'll be gone.
