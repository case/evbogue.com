### Support for Hard Ass Work

> Why isn't there more support for people doing hard ass work?

I keep getting emails (indirectly) from a reader who thinks I'm too close to going the [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) route. I.E. hanging from a ceiling fan in my Brooklyn apartment. 

She mentions I'm from Chicago, he's from Chicago. She mentions I'm into coding, and he was into coding. She mentions we both thought highschool was bullshit, and dropped out after 9th grade. We're both into changing the world. We're both not into taking corporate America tech jobs where we have to suck someone's dick all day long in order to get a pay check. We're both obsessive type A personalities who can only focus on moving the ball down the court.

What she hasn't mentioned is I also share a lot of characteristics with another late hacker, [Ilya Zhitomirskiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Zhitomirskiy). He's not from Chicago, but he and I both went to NYU. He and I were both into distributed peer to peer social netwokring. I'm still into distributed social.

I didn't know Aaron Swartz when he was alive. I'd probably seen him around the Internet, but we'd never had contact. I also didn't know Ilya, but I thought (and still think) distributed soical needs to happen before we have freedom to connect online.

However, when Aaron died, I felt really sad. I was living in a basement at the time. Most of the people in my family were regularly sending me aggressive emails. I had $0 in my bank accounts. Distributed social seemed like a far away dream I would have no impact on creating.

When Aaron died. A lot of people wrote about the fact that if he'd only called, they would have picked up the phone. If he'd only reached out, they would have said a few words and everything would be better.

The trouble is, and I'm speaking from experience here, when you're Aaron or Ilya, no one picks up the phone for you. Every one of these motherfuckers writing these pieces is lying. They would not have picked up the phone.

Yes, you write that after the fact to cover your ass. But the truth is you did not support the work when these people were alive. Why? Because distributed social networking is scary. It ruins your idea of your life, where you hit the 'pay to promote' button and get new friends. As if this myth is reality anyway. 

Because reality is no one is looking at you. No one cares. Reality is you are not helping move the ball down the court. Reality is you're at a shitty job you hate, and you and your work hasn't stood for something in years.

There is very little support for people who are doing the hard ass work that needs to be done. 95% of America is sucking pipe from centralized social networks and when they're not on these channels, they've flipped on the television and are watching more bullshit coming from CNN and Fox News. 

So yes, I'm an outlier. I'm an outcast. I know more about my computer than you do yours.

Is this something to be worried about?

Yes. Because me knowing more about my computer threatens you. Me wanting the world to change, while you want it to stay the same is scary. Me getting to work every single day on subjects that both challenge the status quo, and undermine the authority of centralized giant corporations that want to control the flow of information online.

And you don't want to go up against that. 

Because if you were going up against that you'd probably kill yourself too.

Look. The reason hackers working on impossible projects kill themselves is because you don't support their work.

Yes, you send emails saying 'please don't kill yourself like Aaron'. But you do not send money.

If you want to support me, [send me money](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=QUZZ9H3B3KBNL). [Buy Deploy Node](http://deployno.de). Or find some way to support distributed peer to peer social. Or have the balls to leave F***book or Shitter, or whatever horrible centralized social network is brainwashing you every single day.

But no, don't email saying 'please don't kill yourself'. It doesn't make things easier out here on the edge. 

And no. I won't step back. You need to step up.

### The Deep End

I wander through the racks of Barnes and Noble in Union Square. I'm looking for Node.js. Here it is, the one O'reilly book. It's good. I can't hate on it. It's just too bad it's written about Node 6.4, back before there were things like the streaming API. 
 
The other topic I'm looking for, one of the most popular channels on IRC, is nowhere to be found on the racks.

The technological scene changes so fast, it's hard to keep up when you're printed on paper.

You know you're in the deep end when it hasn't hit the shelves yet. You know you're at the technological edge when no one has heard of it. 

And isn't the point to be on the edge?

Why are we so shy of edges? 

In New York we have lots of rooftop parties. People call everyone up and they show up with bottles of vodka and tonic. 

I'm always the first person sitting at the edge of the roof with my legs dangling over the edge. Yes, I could fall. But I won't. I promise. 

And when it's my time to jump, I promise there will be no fuckin' way you will stop me.

So are you only coming up to the edge to tell me not to jump? Because that's useless. There's no way I'm listening to you. Because the topics I'm interested in aren't in Barnes and Noble yet. And as one of my roommates just mentioned, they are slowly closing all of the Barnes and Nobles in Manhattan. I can't even think of a Barnes and Noble in Brooklyn. 

What will all of you Normals do when the the last Barnes and Noble closes? How will you know what's in? Will you just buy the latest bullshit that's put in front of you. Or will you develop the intuition to know what the cutting edge of technological evolution is? 

The way I look at it, you need to be [deploying Node.js](http://deployno.de) if you call yourself a technologist. Right now. Not two years from now.

This is the edge. It's not jumping off it. Someday it'll be the middle. By that time I'll be gone.
