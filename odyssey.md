### Introduction 

#### by [Ven Portman](mailto:ven@venportman.com)

All is not as it seems in this story of an idealistic dreamer who falls tragically short of achieving the ultimate.

Ev Bogue is, and was, a man desperate in his pursuit of a career as a professional writer. Even when everyone else said he would fail, he continued to do everything in his power to make this dream a reality. Only to shirk this dream to vanish deeper into the machine.

This is The Odyssey. The story is told over the course of four ebooks, released by Ev Bogue over his short but powerful career as a professional writer. 

Before Ev Bogue vanished deeper into the machine, he asked me to pass his work back to you. It's packaged up into one complete work, spanning the years 2009 - 2012.

When you buy [The Odyssey](http://evbogue.fetchapp.com/sell/waleeyol/ppc), you'll get the following...

### The Art of Being Minimalist

#### by Everett Bogue | February 2010 | PDF

Ev Bogue's first ebook about how to git rid of all of your stuff in order to enjoy more freedom and autonomy in life. Some consider it a quaint but naive tale of a new writer brave and desparate to escape the tangled urban jungle of New York City to travel the globe. 

Original price: $17

### Minimalist Business

#### By Everett Bogue | May 2010 | PDF

Ev Bogue's second ebook about how to live and work from anywhere. In this package, Ev Bogue lays down the smackdown, as well as the strategies you needed to succeed online in 2010. Some consider this a time capsule to a world where all you had to do was get on Twitter and magic would happen. This ebook made Ev Bogue (temporarily) rich and famous beyond his wildest dreams, only to use this new-found money to wander the streets of Oakland and San Francisco bitter and alone.

Original price: $47

### Augmented Humanity

#### By Ev Bogue | February 2011 | PDF

Following his success as an location independent internet superstar, Ev Bogue began to see the world in a strange new light. Unable to distinguish between reality and The Internet, he began to see cyborgs living amongst humans. In his mind, there was suddenly a strong divide between those people who'd learned to integrate technology into their lives, and those who had not. Crazy or brilliant? You decide.

Original price: $30

### Untether

#### By Ev Bogue | May 2012 | HTML or NODE.JS

After coming to terms with his status as a falling star in the digital business/inspiration section, Ev Bogue turned his attention to his glorious and final work on how to get rid of your physical and psychic stuff. Untether explores, in great depth, a foolproof way to remove anything from your life that is holding you back.

Original price: $37

In one final act of untethering Ev Bogue decided to untether from his given name. He made up a name in February 2012, and over the course of 16 months he gradually began to bring his new pseudonymous avatar online.

So the real question is, who is Ev Bogue? Is Ev Bogue also Ven Portman? Or was Ven Portman deep within his core always Ev Bogue?

What it is in a name anyway?

As you dig deeper into The Odyssey, the collected works of Ev Bogue, you will find yourself falling deeper into this question.

Together, all of these offerings would have been priced at $131. Now, they're packed together at the reduced price of only $97.
