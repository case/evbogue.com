### Letters on deploying a distributed Internet

#### (And whatever the hell else I want to write about)

Two years ago I managed to get 250 people to pay me $25 a month to hear from me in their inboxes for a year. This freed me up from thinking too much about products, and instead I was able to just write my mind.

Now, I'd like to try doing similar thing. This time donation-based using [Gittip](http://www.gittip.com/evbogue). You sign up for the letter, I'll write. If you like what I'm writing, consider supporting the work.

To deliver to your Inbox, I've decided to use Mailchimp. Mailchimp has always been a force in the dev world, but in the last year they've really upped their game with an beautiful editor + and a new responsive design hitting the decks soon.

This doesn't mean I'm going to stop writing to the public web. It just means the most experimental and cutting edge writing will be coming to your inbox. 

The more support I can get for this work with Gittip, the more I'll write to you. 

If you get something out of it, tell someone. Don't keep it to yourself. Forward the messages around, backchannel-like.

What you'll get when you subscribe...

1. Letters on web development
2. Technical writing about Node.js and other technologies
